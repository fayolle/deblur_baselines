# Image deblurring baselines 

Implementation of standard methods for deblurring an image (deconvolution). The implemented methods are: 

* Richardson-Lucy ('RL.m'), as well as a semi-blind variant ('RL_f.m') 
* The Biggs-Andrews acceleration of Richardson-Lucy iterations ('RL_BA.m')
* The Iterative Image Space Reconstruction Algorithm ('ISRA.m'), as well as a semi-blind variant ('ISRA_f.m')
* Wiener deconvolution ('Wiener.m')
